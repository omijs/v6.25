Congratulations on completing all the tutorials.

Now you can start the OMI journey directly in the following ways.

## Installation  

Download it directly and import it with the `<script>` tag. OMI will be registered as a global variable.


* [OMI development version](https://unpkg.com/omi@latest/dist/omi.js)
* [OMI compressed version](https://unpkg.com/omi@latest/dist/omi.min.js)

It can also be installed through npm:

```bash
npm i omi
```


## Command line tools

Omi provides the official cli. You don't need to learn how to configure vite, rollup or typescript. Cli helps you configure everything and provides various templates to meet different project types.

### Create project

```bash
$ npx omi-cli init my-app
$ cd my-app           
$ npm start           # develop
$ npm run build       # release
```


### Create component

```bash
$ npx omi-cli init-component my-component
$ cd my-app           
$ npm start           # develop
$ npm run build       # release
```
